			<h1>About Me</h2>
			<p>I have been working almost constantly since I turned 15, taking only time off to focus on school and my love for
			computers. I've worked in a manufacturing plant, for a school district technology department, in the restaurant
			industry, and in food production, giving me a very wide scope of experience to draw from. These softer skills compliment
			my computer skills that I learn very well in the classroom, as shown by my GPA, and at home.
			
			I love to learn, and so while I continue to improve my Python, Web Development, and Linux skills I realize I still have
			an infinitely long road ahead of me and can't wait to assemble new tools to add to my technology arsenal.</p>
